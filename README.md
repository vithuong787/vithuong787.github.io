Mr Trịnh Xuân Khanh and Mr David Valois dear! <br>

First of all I thank you very much and on the occasion of the Moon New Year wish you and your family good health and happiness.<br>

Special thanks to your lecture make me changed.
 <br>
In the past I was scared of anything, I fought my fear by saying very very very a lot and very very very chattering, very very very stupid, I saying anythings, any hour, anything, saying non-stop about anything with stupid and crazy.
<br>
Because i scare unemployment, i scare be a homeless, i scare have not food, afraid of colleagues talking badly about me , i scare die,  i scare everything ..., 
<br>
So I was not can sleep at nights, I was full scares after a motorbike accident caused me a broken 2 bones (and lost a new motobycle, lost a big money, lost my old love, lost 3 wisdom teeths :) ),  , and after listening to your lectures, I had the courage to accept the fear that was part of me, when I accept fears, feel fears, I feel like I have let go of the burden, I have changed my mind, my habits & my personality same like 180 degrees.  I accept fear and fear are my best friends so I'm not afraid anymore, I'm afraid the crowd is screaming and cursing, but i am accept this fear as my best friends and I'm not afraid anymore, every day of me is full of  fears and I accept it as part of me, (fears same like is materials make my personality) as my friend and so I'm not afraid anymore.  And I am scare the corona virus, I am afraid of death, but I accept it, I accept that I am afraid of death, I accept that I am afraid of the corona virus, and therefore I am not afraid of viruses, so I no need to wear surgical masks :).  Thanks to your lecture for me, this made me brave (in my mind I always think about brave ants, and observing ants is also my hobby when i was a child).  After listening to your lecture, I was more courage, it is not to fight with fear, it is accept fear, but I bravely accepted the truth, I courageously accepted that I was a timid person, bravely accepted that in me  Filled with fear, bravely accepted the nature of myself.  And since then I have found the passion and dream of my life, what I want, where I am, and where I am going in my life.  I'm scared even when I write this comment, but I accept this fear, this fear is my best friend and so I'm not scared anymore, I'm scared of those who hate me, I'm afraid they're ready  willing to do anything make me fail, but I accept this fear, this fear is my best friend.  Your lecture was great, it was same like the "first brick" build my new personality & my new thinkings & my new habits: thinking long-term, have passions, have dream, 'building a fortress of habit', accept i am not not perfectibility, accept fears inside me, careful with other persons advice, try again if mistakes, and unlimited.
